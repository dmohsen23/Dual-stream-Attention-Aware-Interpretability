## 📝 Overview

**Distal myopathies** are genetically heterogeneous muscle disorders characterized by specific myofiber alterations.  
This repository implements an **Attention-Gated Multimodal Fusion** model that:  
- Fuses **global** (ResNet50) + **local** (BagNet33) features  
- Generates saliency maps for explainability  
- Evaluates interpretability quantitatively & via clinician feedback  

---

## ✨ Features

- 🔍 **High Accuracy** on BUSI & Distal Myopathy datasets  
- 🧠 **Attention-Aware Fusion** for improved discrimination  
- 📊 **Functionally Grounded Metrics**: coherence score, incremental deletion  
- 👩‍⚕️ **Application-Grounded Validation**: survey & thematic analysis with radiologists
