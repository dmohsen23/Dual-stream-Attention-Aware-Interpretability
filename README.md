# Multimodal-Attention-Aware-Interpretability
A deep learning framework for diagnosing distal myopathy with enhanced explainability via attention-gated multimodal fusion. Our architecture integrates global and local feature extractors and generates saliency maps whose interpretability is evaluated both quantitatively and by expert radiologists.
